export const HEROABOUT_TEXT = `
I'm a passionate Flutter developer specializing in crafting beautiful, high-performance cross-platform mobile applications. With expertise in Dart and the Flutter framework, I build apps that deliver native-like experiences on both iOS and Android platforms.

My development approach combines:
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Responsive UI/UX design principles
- State management solutions (Provider, Bloc, Riverpod)
- Firebase integration for backend services
- Custom animations and fluid transitions

I take pride in staying at the forefront of Flutter's ecosystem, constantly exploring new packages and best practices. My apps are not just functional - they're polished experiences with attention to detail in every pixel and interaction.

Beyond coding, I'm an active contributor to Flutter communities and enjoy:
- Experimenting with new UI design patterns
- Optimizing app performance metrics
- Mentoring junior developers
- Participating in hackathons and code challenges

When I'm not building apps, you'll find me:
‚ôüÔ∏è Competing in local chess tournaments (great for strategic thinking!)
üéπ Playing piano (which helps my sense of timing and rhythm in animations)
üé® Exploring Japanese design aesthetics that often inspire my UI work

I believe great apps come from the perfect blend of technical excellence and creative vision - which is exactly what I bring to every project.
